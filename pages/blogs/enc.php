        <h2>Encourage children to STEM</h2>
        <p class="excert">     
On the month of April, our STEM children demonstrated their game idea in the International Girls in ICT Day 2017, Kathmandu. They were so confident during the presentation. They learned mass facing of 200+ people from renowned institutions and organizations which also included Ministry of Information and Communications, chairman of Nepal Telecommunication Authority and more. Not only they showcase what they have built but also answered the cross-questions, concepts and looping ideas gracefully.
