        <h2>An Hour of Code Workshop</h2>
        <p class="excert">
Itâ€™s a Mentoring & Coding workshop program focuses on an introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics in an hour. These workshops are introduced to create an interest in computer programming languages. We have conducted a series of successful hours of code workshops. In the fifth edition, we are focusing on Javascript programming language basics and developing the first JS game with Women in STEM Nepal. 
Hour of code fifth series was sponsored by The Asia Foundation Nepal as the pre-event of women in data conference which was held in February 2019. We are extremely grateful to have your support. 
Do you want us to conduct the next workshop at your college or school?
